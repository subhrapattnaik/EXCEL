Syntax

The syntax of the IF function is as follows:

    =IF(logical test,[value if true],[value if false])

    logical test: This is the condition we would like to check. We can check conditions using various operations, such as equals (“=”), greater than (“>”), smaller than (“<“) or even different (“<>”). So, let’s say we want to check if Cell A2 is greater than cell A1, we will write it this way: A2>A1
    value if true – What the function will return if our condition is met.
    value if false – What the function will return if our condition is not met. If we leave this one empty, we’ll get “FALSE”.

Let’s say we want to check if A2 is greater than A1, and return “A2 is greater” if it’s true, and return “A2 is not greater” if it’s not true. This is what we’ll type:

    =IF(A2>A1,”A2 is greater”,”A2 is not greater”)

   Syntax

Hereinafter an example of an IF statement under the “value if FALSE” argument:

    =IF(logical test,value if TRUE,IF(logical test, Value if TRUE, Value if FALSE)

Hereinafter an example of an IF statement under “value if the TRUE” argument:

    =IF(logical test,IF(logical test, Value if TRUE, Value if FALSE), value if FALSE)
    
    
  Example:
  
    
    =IF(B9 = "Fulltime",IF(B10 > 4.5,"Yes Discount","No Discount"),"No Discount")
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    Instructions: create a nested if formula where:					
1. Conditions:					
First condition Full-Time					
Second condition GPA Greater than 4.5					
2. Results:					
Gets a discount – return “Yes", otherwise “No"					
The following formula is a great example of how to use Nested If in this case. 					
=IF(B9="Full-Time",IF(B10>4.5,"Yes","No"),"No")					
Alternatively, you could switch between the first and the second conditions:					
=IF(B10>4.5,IF(B9="Full-Time","Yes","No"),"No")					
There are many other ways you could test 2 or more conditions! We believe that the two examples above are the easiest =)					----------------------------------------------
