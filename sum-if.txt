The syntax of the SUMIF function is as follows:

    =SUMIF(range,criteria,[sum_range])

    range – This is the range in which our criteria will be checked.
    criteria – This is the criteria we’ll check
    [sum_range] – This is the range we’d like to sum (only for the cells that matched our criteria).
